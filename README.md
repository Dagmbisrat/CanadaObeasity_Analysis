This project provides an in-depth analysis of obesity rates in Canada, focusing on trends across provinces and different age groups. Using C-based data processing, the system calculates and displays provincial and national averages of obesity rates for various years and demographics. Visualizations are generated with GNUPlot to display data through line plots and bar charts, helping to identify trends and patterns in obesity rates across the country.

Key Features:

Data Analysis: Calculates obesity percentages at the national and provincial levels.
Demographic Breakdown: Focus on trends across various age groups.
Visualizations: Line plots and bar charts using GNUPlot for clear representation of trends.
C-based System: Efficiently processes and displays large sets of statistical data.
